    <img class='about_img' src='/assets/Mina_fixed.jpg'/>
    <p></p>
    <p class='about_info'>Mina is a full-stack web developer with a passion for developing educational tools and helping social-impact organizations have the platforms they need to meet their goals. As mentor to high school students for 5+ years, she was met with the challenge of showing them that math is still very useful to their everyday lives. She turned to programming not only as a means of creating tools for them to learn with but also to demonstrate how simple concepts they were introduced to in classrooms are used in programming. Now, she cannot help but see everything (social interactions included) through an if-else lens.<p>

    <p class='about_info'>Mina's journey into the world of coding and developing has been amazing with the help of the nurturing village at LEARN Academy. She's excited to experience what's next.</p>
